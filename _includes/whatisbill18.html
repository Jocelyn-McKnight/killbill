                <p class="text-faded">Alberta Bill 18, known as the Provincial Priorities Act, 2024, is a legislative proposal that mandates provincial oversight and approval of any contractual or collaborative agreements between Alberta's provincial entities and the federal government. This includes a broad range of institutions and bodies within the province, particularly targeting educational institutions such as universities and colleges. The bill is structured to ensure that any such agreements align with the specific priorities and policies set by the provincial government.</p>
<p>This legislation was introduced as a part of the Alberta government's broader strategy to assert more control and oversight over provincial affairs, especially those that involve interactions with the federal government. By requiring prior approval for these agreements, the bill aims to ensure that the engagements are consistent with Albertaâ€™s strategic interests and provincial autonomy. The bill represents a significant shift in how provincial and federal interactions are managed, potentially affecting the autonomy of institutions in negotiating directly with the federal government and in pursuing objectives that may not fully align with provincial directives.</p>
